# squint-pixijs-sprite-jam

[Inspired on X](https://x.com/turjanofmiir/status/1906129672766623903)

I saw a cool thread about asking GPT-4o to generate sprite sheets so I wanted to test it out with
a library designed to work with them. I just wanted to see how well the sprite sheets work out of the box.

This example uses:
- [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)
- [Squint](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint)
- [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/)

## Development

Requires node + npm to install deps.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start Vite with [babashka](https://babashka.org/).

```bash
$ bb dev
```
